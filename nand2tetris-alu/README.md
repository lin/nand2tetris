The tricks are two:

1. `V.x x & 0 = 0` and `x & 1 = x`

   using this tool to select what we want to output.

2. `V.x x | 0 = x`

   using this tool to output the final output.

   it's like a cheated elections, with only one real candidate, all others are dead.

in the assembly, `x^x = 0`, it's another trick.
